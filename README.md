# computer-sales-datawarehouse
Construction of a complete Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence pipeline developed as part of the Laboratory of Data Science course.
The project integrates ETL, Data Warehouse design, MDX queries, and Power BI visualization to analyze computer sales data.

Technologies Used
- Python (ETL, preprocessing)
- SQL Server & SSIS (data integration and loading)
- SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for OLAP cube creation
- MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) for cube querying
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboarding

  

Project Structure:
- Assignment_1&2: Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- Assignment_3: Integration Services (SSIS) project: control flows, data flows, and ETL automation.
- Assignment_4: SQL Server Data Warehouse schema and cube definition.
- Assignment_5: MDX queries to analyze measures and dimensions within the OLAP cube.
- Assignment_6: Power BI dashboards for sales performance insights by brand, continent, and year.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a full data-driven analytical system for computer sales.
Starting from raw data, the process includes:
- Data cleaning and transformation (Python ETL)
- Loading into a SQL Server Data Warehouse
- Creating a multidimensional cube (OLAP)
- Querying using MDX
- Building interactive Power BI dashboards for insights.
